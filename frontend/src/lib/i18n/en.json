    "content": "Dear Hiring Manager and the Applied AI Team at UMCG,\n\nWelcome to my application. I built this interactive website over a weekend for one reason: to demonstrate my passion for building practical, full-stack AI solutions and my ability to rapidly learn and deploy new technologies.\n\nIn my current role, my focus is always on creating tangible value by reducing cognitive load and streamlining complex workflows. I've developed an automated transcription service that turns support calls into structured tickets and built an intelligent support bot using LangChain and RAG to give my colleagues instant access to knowledge. While I am proud of these technical achievements, I am most energized when I can innovate and experiment. This drive to build and take initiative is why the description of your team attracted me (as a place where \"ideas and initiative are truly valued\"). My recent conversation with Akshay Biere confirmed this, and I am incredibly excited by the prospect of joining an optimistic and forward-thinking team that is not afraid to try and fail together.\n\nMy desire to join UMCG is also a deliberate choice to align my technical skills with work that is unambiguously positive. My career has always balanced a passion for technology with a focus on people, from my studies in Psychology to my work in a client-facing support role. I thrive on helping others, and I am looking for an environment where that help has a clear and meaningful impact. The opportunity to develop solutions that directly support patients, assist clinicians, or accelerate medical research offers a sense of purpose that is uniquely compelling.\n\nThis website itself is a testament to my capabilities. To build it, I taught myself Svelte (a framework mentioned in your vacancy that I had no experience with) and integrated a Flask backend with an OpenAI-powered chat via WebSockets. It demonstrates my full-stack proficiency and my commitment to continuous learning. While I haven't worked extensively with Microsoft Azure yet, my quick grasp of Svelte and my experience with Docker and cloud deployments make me confident that I can master the Azure AI stack swiftly. I am eager to dive into Azure Machine Learning and OpenAI services and am prepared to pursue certifications to formalize that knowledge.\n\nI am confident that my practical skills, learning agility, and genuine drive to contribute to smart healthcare will enable me to be a valuable member of your team from day one.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nMet vriendelijke groet (With kind regards),\nSander Kaatee\n\nP.S. I invite you to interact with the AI chat on this site. I built it as a practical way to demonstrate the skills mentioned in your vacancy, from prompt engineering to API integration. Jokingly, it's ready to conduct the first round of the interview. It's a small example of the hands-on, experimental approach I'm excited to bring to the Applied AI team."
